Explanation:

Mocking the Repository: We're using Mockito's @Mock to mock the AccountRepository so that we don't need to interact with the actual database during testing.
Injecting the Mocks: We use @InjectMocks to inject the mocked dependencies into AccountServiceImpl.
Set Up Method: setUp() initializes the mocks and sets up basic data for testing.

@Mock: Creates a mock instance of the AccountService that you can control.
@InjectMocks: Injects the mock AccountService into the AccountController.
MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this): Initializes the mocks.
when(...).thenReturn(...): Specifies the behavior of the mock AccountService.
verify(...): Verifies that the AccountService method was called a specific number of times.
any() and anyDouble(): Used to match any object or double parameter in the mock method calls.
